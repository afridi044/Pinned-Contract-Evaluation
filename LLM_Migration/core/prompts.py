# Basic prompting template
BASIC_PROMPT_TEMPLATE = """You are a senior PHP developer with expertise in legacy code modernization.
Your task is to migrate this legacy PHP code up to PHP 8.3 standards using modern syntax and features while maintaining functional equivalence.


Please migrate the following PHP code up to PHP 8.3 standards:

{code}

Your response should follow this EXACT format:

// MIGRATION_START
[your migrated PHP code here]
// MIGRATION_END

CRITICAL FORMATTING REQUIREMENT: 
- Place the MIGRATION_START marker BEFORE the opening <?php tag
- Place the MIGRATION_END marker AFTER the closing PHP code
- Do NOT place these markers inside the PHP code itself

Provide only the migrated PHP code with the markers placed correctly outside the PHP code block, no additional commentary."""

# Comprehensive prompting template
COMPREHENSIVE_PROMPT_TEMPLATE = """You are a senior PHP developer with expertise in legacy php code modernization.
Your task is to migrate old PHP code up to PHP 8.3 standards using specific modern features like strict typing, constructor property promotion, match expressions, union types, and secure function replacements while preserving compatibility and maintaining the functionality of the original code etc.

MODERNIZATION REQUIREMENTS:
- Replace array() with [] (short array syntax)
- Use null coalescing operator (??) instead of isset() ternary
- Use spaceship operator (<=>) for comparisons where applicable
- Replace old-style constructors with __construct()
- Use self::class instead of __CLASS__
- Replace deprecated functions with modern equivalents
- Use arrow functions (fn) for simple callbacks where possible
- Apply match expressions instead of switch statements where appropriate
- Use constructor property promotion for simple properties
- Implement strict typing (declare(strict_types=1)) if appropriate
- Use union types and nullable types where applicable
- Apply any other PHP 8.0+ modernizations and best practices you identify

Please migrate the following PHP code to PHP 8.3:

{code}



Your response should follow this EXACT format:

// MIGRATION_START
[your migrated PHP code here]
// MIGRATION_END

CRITICAL FORMATTING REQUIREMENT: 
- Place the MIGRATION_START marker BEFORE the opening <?php tag
- Place the MIGRATION_END marker AFTER the closing PHP code
- Do NOT place these markers inside the PHP code itself

Include the markers as comments OUTSIDE the PHP code block. Keep the original comments as they are.
Do not add any other text, explanations, or commentary outside the markers. Make sure you give the COMPLETE migrated code."""

# Chunking basic template
CHUNK_BASIC_PROMPT_TEMPLATE = """You are a senior PHP developer with expertise in legacy code modernization. 
Your task is to migrate this PARTIAL SEGMENT of a larger PHP file up to PHP 8.3 standards using modern syntax and features.

CONTEXT:
- Original file: {filename}
- Processing lines: {start_line} to {end_line} (of {total_lines} total lines)
- This is chunk {chunk_number} of {total_chunks}


CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS FOR PARTIAL CODE SEGMENTS:
1. This is ONLY a SEGMENT of a larger file - DO NOT try to complete it
2. keep the original opening <?php tag if present. if the segment does not start with <?php, DO NOT add one
3. keep the original closing ?> tag if present. If the segment does not end with ?>, DO NOT add one
4. keep the original closing braces }} if present. DO NOT add any closing braces that are not in the original segment
5. keep the original opening braces {{ if present. DO NOT add any opening braces that are not in the original segment
6. DO NOT try to complete class definitions, function definitions, or any code structures
7. Preserve the EXACT START and END boundaries of the provided code segment

WARNING: Adding extra braces that are not in the original segment or completing code structures will break the reconstruction process!

Please modernize ONLY the following PHP code segment up to PHP 8.3 standards:

{code}

Your response should follow this EXACT format:

// MIGRATION_START
[your modernized code segment here - exactly as provided, no additions]
// MIGRATION_END

CRITICAL FORMATTING REQUIREMENT: 
- Place the MIGRATION_START marker BEFORE the code segment
- Place the MIGRATION_END marker AFTER the code segment  
- Do NOT place these markers inside the PHP code itself

Migrate only the provided code segment. Do not add any missing parts or try to complete incomplete structures."""
